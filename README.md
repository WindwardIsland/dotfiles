<h1 align="center">WindwardIsland/dotfiles</h1>

This repository stores all my configuration files for various programs on Linux that I use.

Feel free to poke around in here and take and use whatever you think might be useful on your Linux system.

This repository is managed with [yadm](https://yadm.io/) which is a dotfile manager that creates a local git repo for your dotfiles, instead of being a bare repo of your entire $HOME. I previously used a git bare repository to manage my dotfiles, but I found managing them to be somewhat cumbersome, and being a bare repository, the changes reflected on the remote repo would also reflect locally on my machine. yadm basically takes what bare git repos already had and just makes it better.
